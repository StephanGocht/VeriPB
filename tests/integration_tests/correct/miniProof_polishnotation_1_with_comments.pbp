pseudo-Boolean proof version 1.0
* This is the proof of the formula

* load the formula
f
* add some constraints
p 3 1 * 4 1 * + s
* check that the constraint with Id 6 is equal to the given constraint

e 6 1 x1 +1 x3 >= 1;
p 1 2 + 6 +
e 7 +2 x1 +2 x2 +2 x3 >= 3;
p 1 2 + 6 + 2 d
e 8 1 x1 1 x2 1 x3 >= 2;
p 5 2 * 8 2 * +
e 9 >= 2;
*check contardiction
* hopefully this works
c 9
* thats it!
