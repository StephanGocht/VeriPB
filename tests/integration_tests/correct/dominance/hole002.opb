* pigeon~3_2: placing 3 pigeons into 2 holes
*
* The SAT encoding of this problem is very straightforward.  For each pigeon i
* and each hole j we have a variable x_{n*(i~1)+j} which means that pigeon i
* is placed in hole j.  Then we have m clauses which say that a pigeon has
* to be placed in some hole.  Then for each hole we have a set of clauses
* ensuring that only one single pigeon is placed into that hole.
*
* This encoding leads to a total of m * n propositional variables and
* m + n * (n * m / 2) clauses.
